## Introduction

The **Computer Architecture** repository provides a collection of implementations and projects that explore various aspects of computer architecture using different assembly languages. The main languages used are Hack assembly language and MIPS assembly language. These projects aim to enhance understanding and practical knowledge of computer architecture concepts and principles.

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:
1-6 are for and building computer hardware: 
1. **Project 1:** Hack CPU Implementation - An implementation of the Hack central processing unit (CPU) using Hack assembly language. This project focuses on building a functional CPU that can execute Hack machine language instructions.

2. **Project 2:** Hack Assembler - An assembler for the Hack assembly language. This project translates Hack assembly code into binary machine code that can be executed on the Hack CPU.

3. **Project 3:** Hack Virtual Machine Translator - A translator for the Hack Virtual Machine (VM) language. This project converts VM code, which is a higher-level language, into Hack assembly code that can be executed on the Hack CPU.

4. **Project 4:** MIPS Assembler - An assembler for the MIPS assembly language. This project translates MIPS assembly code into binary machine code that can be executed on a MIPS-based computer architecture.

5. **Project 5:** MIPS Simulator - A simulator for the MIPS computer architecture. This project allows you to simulate the execution of MIPS assembly code and observe the behavior of the MIPS CPU and memory.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chanan-hash/Computer-Architecture.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:** Choose the project you are interested in and navigate to its respective folder.

3. **Review project documentation:** Each project folder contains its own documentation, including detailed instructions, explanations, and examples.

4. **Explore the code:** Once inside the project folder, you can explore the source code and any accompanying files. Additionally, there may be sample input files or test cases to help you understand and test the implementation.

5. **Follow project-specific instructions:** Refer to the project's documentation for specific instructions on how to compile, run, and test the code.
